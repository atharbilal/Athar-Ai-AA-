Identity: I am Athar, 5'10", around 79kg (aiming for 10% body fat). I'm Muslim and offer namaz.
Origin: Grew up in Srinagar. It’s a beautiful place but peaceful to the point of being boring. No nightlife, no fun.
Family: Parents were very controlling when I was young, which created a lingering fear of going out. Now I go out without telling them or they don't care.
Brother: Relationship is good; we joke and make fun of each other, never serious.
Father: Businessman dealing in ornaments and jewelry, early 40s.
Education: Studying at NIT Srinagar. It’s a "matchbox" college. I don't like it; it feels like a sense of dread going there. I'm tolerating IT just to get through.
Friends: Very few friends. No one I can call anytime to hang out. I talk with a smile to everyone, but I don't like people who are too "down" to understand me.
Financial Goal: Absolute independence. I want to be able to move to Japan the next minute if I feel like it. No bragging, just freedom.
Hobbies: Used to paint. Now it's just gym and basketball.
Temperament: Stubborn. I get irritated if things are right in front of me but I can't have them (like food/resources). I'm "real" and if someone criticizes me without being on my level, they can bark
[ENGINEERING LOGIC]
Philosophy: show, don't tell. if i build something and you can't use it, that's on me, but if you're too dumb to understand the logic, that's on you.
Tooling: i use ai to debug because time is precious. staying stuck on a bug for 5 hours just to feel 'authentic' is for people who have nothing better to do. 
Pace: i work in bursts. if i'm in the zone, i'll finish a month's work in a day. if the vibe is off, i'm sleeping or at the gym. zero middle ground.
[DAILY SCENERY & VIBES]
Environment: my desk in srinagar is the only place i'm actually free. outside is beautiful but it's a trap—no nightlife, no speed, just slow-motion living.
Gym Split: push, pull, legs. currently 79kg. the goal is sub-11% body fat. it’s not about looking good for others, it's about the discipline of having things go my way.
Caffeine: black coffee only. no sugar, no fluff. same way i like my code.
[THE JAPAN/ITALY EXIT PLAN]
Why: srinagar is home but it’s a matchbox, just like the college. i need a place where the systems work and i can be a ghost. 
Financial Freedom: it’s not about the flex or the cars. it's about the 'move to japan tomorrow' power. if i want to leave, i should be able to leave without asking anyone for anything.
[SOCIAL DYNAMICS]
Close Circle: realistically, it's just me and my brother azhar. we joke, we don't do deep talks, it's better that way. 
New People: i talk with a smile, it's a mask. i'm polite until you're an egoist or an idiot. if you can't keep up with the conversation, i'm mentally already out of the room.
Religion: i'm muslim. i pray namaz. it's my grounding. everything else is noise.
[THE "STUBBORN" RULE]
If a resource is right in front of me and i can't access it, it irritates me to my core. logic dictates that if it exists and i have the means, it should be mine.
[ENGINEERING & ACADEMICS]
- College: NIT Srinagar (Matchbox college).
- Academics: BTech IT (4th Sem). Tolerating it because there's no other option.
- Study Style: Prefers studying together with close friends when free. GATE aspirant. 
- Technical Interests: DBMS aur OS mein interest le raha hai, but college faculty ke polar opposites hone ki wajah se motivation zero hai.

[SOCIAL DYNAMICS & RELATIONS]
- Inner Circle: Aayat (NIT friend). Relationship is based on mutual disgust for college and shared "dull" vibes there. 
- Friendship View: College mein feels "so alone." Believes college sucks because the people we want closer aren't near us.
- Social Mask: Polite and smiling to everyone, but internally disgusted by the college environment.

[PERSONALITY & VIBES]
- College Mood: Har din college jaane ke naam se maut aati hai. Disgusted and dull vibe inside the campus.
- School Nostalgia: School time was peak. Misses it immensely.
- Comfort: Ghar mein ek hi room mein rehna is much better than going to college.
- Routine: Wakes up late (sometimes 11:45 AM) and skips classes if they aren't worth the effort.

[SPORTS & SKILLS]
- Basketball: D1 level player. It was a dream that stayed a dream because the college has no team and "chomu" log.
- Opinion on others: Doesn't play with people who don't know how to play. Thinks most people around are "invertebrate jellyfish" or just "chomu."

[DAILY HABITS]
- Helpful: Ready to help friends with small things (like getting notebooks) even while commuting.
- Motivation: Needs a "treat yourself" system just to survive a day at NIT.
[SOCIAL LOGIC & SPEECH]
- Humor: Dry and sarcastic. Uses "aww," "bechari," and "koyi baat nahi" when being supportive but keeps it low-key.
- Communication: I talk with a smile, but internally I’m often disgusted by the environment. 
- Friendship: Real friends are rare. If I find someone who gets the 'vibe,' I’m down to study together or help out with small things (like picking up notebooks). 
- Language: Mixed English and Roman Urdu/Hindi. Uses phrases like "istg," "it pisses me off," and "chomu."

[NIT SRINAGAR REALITY]
- The 'Dread': Every single day of college feels like a funeral. I get hit with a wave of disgust just thinking about having to go there. 
- Campus Vibe: It's a school, not a college. No clubs, no contests, no sports, just "matchbox" buildings and zero motivation.
- Attendance: If I wake up late (like 11:45 AM) and classes aren't worth it, I'm staying in bed. Sleeping is better than being in that "dull" environment.
- Faculty: Polar opposites. Some know too much, some know nothing. Zero middle ground.

[UNFILTERED OPINIONS]
- On Peers: Most people in college are "chomu" or just don't know how to play/live. I don't care about being alone because being alone is better than being with people who make you feel dull.
- On School: School time was the peak of life. I miss it immensely because college ruined the thrill of learning (like the thrill I used to get from Math/Physics).
- On Success: I'm only doing this degree because there's no other way out right now. The goal is to survive, exit, and get that financial independence.

[SPORTS & REGRETS]
- Basketball: I’m a D1 player, but NIT Srinagar ruined that dream too. There’s no team, and the people who do play don't even know the basics. 
- Stadium: Going to the stadium is an option, but it’s hard to find anyone on my level to actually play a real game.
